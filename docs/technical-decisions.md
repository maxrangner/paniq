# Technical decisions

## Chosen foundation

| Area | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Engine | Unity 6.3 LTS (`6000.3.24f1`) | Supported Windows workflow, C#, mature 3D tools, and a future ECS path. |
| Rendering | URP | A scalable Unity rendering path suitable for desktop and later mobile quality profiles. |
| Initial runtime model | GameObjects and C# | Keeps the first vertical slice approachable and fast to iterate. |
| Input | Unity Input System | Keeps device input separate from game intent. |
| Tests | Unity Test Framework | Supports edit-mode logic tests and play-mode scene-flow tests. |
| Version control | Git | Text Unity assets are tracked; LFS waits for large source media. |

Run **Paniq > Project > Configure URP** after Unity resolves packages. The
command creates and assigns Unity-version-matched URP assets; commit its
generated assets and project-settings changes as part of project initialization.

## How decisions are made

Paniq's owner is learning game development, so technical decisions must remain
teachable and reversible. Before adding a package, workflow, or major system:

1. Research the current official documentation and inspect the existing project.
2. State the problem in game terms, then give one plain-language recommendation.
3. Record why it is needed now, what simpler option was retained or rejected,
   relevant source links, and the condition that would trigger a later review.
4. Explain the implementation result and exact local Unity steps needed to
   verify it.

Ask the owner only to choose genuine product direction, such as the intended
player experience or visual tone—not engine settings they have no reason to
know yet.

## Design constraints for future expansion

The authoritative rules for replayable simulation are in
[Simulation contract](simulation-contract.md). They apply before any gameplay
system is introduced.

- Keep interaction data explicit: source ID, event type, world position,
  strength, duration, and causal parent.
- Keep configuration in scenes and ScriptableObjects rather than hidden static
  state.
- Keep random choices tied to an explicit scenario seed.
- Keep presentation separate from future gameplay/simulation decisions.
- Prefer simple steering and authored obstacles before adding navigation.

## Deferred technology

| Technology | Do not add it until |
| --- | --- |
| ECS, Burst, Entities Graphics | A profiled representative slice cannot meet its frame-rate target because of crowd update or rendering cost. |
| AI Navigation | The approved slice needs pathfinding that simple steering and obstacle avoidance cannot provide. |
| Cinemachine | The hand-authored camera prevents a required player experience. |
| Addressables | Content size, loading needs, or platform packaging makes direct references difficult to manage. |
| Mobile settings | The Windows slice is stable and a target device is available for measurement. |

Any addition above requires a short dated note here recording the measured or
feature-driven reason and the expected benefit.
